        "q": "Our company would like to have a booth at COSCUP. Which sponsorship level should we choose?",
        "a": "Please choose \"Gold,\" \"Diamond,\" or \"Titanium,\" and then select the booth level.\nPhysical booths allow for interaction with attendees, and COSCUP will also prepare activities for attendees to visit each booth. Sponsors can get to know the attendees better through surveys and giveaways, which is a great way to recruit talents and deepen the impression of attendees.\nThe booth is a popular option for additional purchases. But due to the limited number of booths, only Gold-level sponsors or above have the right to purchase booths."

        "q": "What is the difference between a Prime session, a Technical session, a Workshop, and a 30-minute Session?",

It will be a 45-minute speech during a non-exclusive time slot, and all the programs are taking place simultaneously. This speech is only available to Diamond-level sponsors or higher.\nA Technical session is a 30-minute speech that will take place on Day 1 in RB 105 and all the programs are taking place simultaneously.  This speech is only available to sponsors at the Gold level or higher. \nBoth Prime and Technical sessions take place in RB 105, a venue that can hold up to 500 people.\nThe Workshop is a two-hour session that will take place on Day 2.\nThe Session (30min) is a 30-minute speech that will take place on Day 2.\nBoth Workshop and Session (30min) speeches will take place in the TR Building, and only sponsors at the Gold level or higher can add them to their package.\nAll speech time slots are limited and have a purchasing deadline, please confirm with your sponsorship window to check if there are available to book earlier and avoid missing out. Additionally, we encourage you to follow the Call For Papers and let your engineers choose the community they are interested in presenting."

      {
        "q": "How are the logos of the sponsors listed on website? How were the booths chosen?",
        "a": "To protect the position of sponsor logos and to ensure fairness, the ranking of sponsor logos and the selection of booths are determined by \"sponsorship level\" and \"order of sponsorship payment.\"\nFor Gold-level sponsors who have purchased a booth, the logo of the earliest paid sponsor will be ranked first, and the booth location will be selected first."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can sponsors request the personal information of the participants?",
        "a": "COSCUP does not provide personal information of attendees to sponsors.\nThe organizer agrees to allow sponsors to promote, provide swags, recruit talent, and collect personal information from attendees at their booths with the consent of the attendees."
      },
      {
        "q": "Why don't I see a physical brochure or an opportunity to place pamphlets?",
        "a": "COSCUP has been going paperless for the past few years (Let's save some trees!) Attendees will read the agenda via the website and OPass app.\nIn addition to the \"Friends\" level of sponsorship, other levels of sponsorship will receive an electronic version of the advertisement, which will be broadcasted as users read the agenda (the frequency of ads depends on the level of sponsorship.) If you would like more exposure, you are welcome to purchase additional ads on the agenda page of the website."
      },
      {
        "q": "If the epidemic rises again, will COSCUP still be held as usual? How will the sponsorship fee be calculated?",
        "a": "In response to the announcement of the Central Epidemic Command Center of Taiwan to prohibit indoor gathering activities, COSCUP will be conducted as an online video live broadcast, with the sponsor's logo exposed before and after the video. The sponsorship fee is 60% of the total sponsorship (external tax)."
      },
      {
        "q": "Can unused sponsorship benefits be refunded?",
